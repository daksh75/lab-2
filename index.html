    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous mammal known as one of the most powerful and iconic animals in the wild.
         It is often referred to as the "King of the Jungle," although lions actually live in grasslands and savannas, not jungles.
        Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small endangered population in the Gir Forest of India. Male lions
        are easily recognized by their thick manes, which vary in color and size, while females are smaller and do not have manes.

    <p>The Ford F-150 Raptor is one of the most well-known off-road trucks in the automotive industry, designed specifically for
        high performance in rugged and challenging terrains. It is powered by a high-output 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 engine,
        delivering up to 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission for smooth and 
        responsive shifting.</p>

    <p>Mountain landscapes are some of the most dramatic and diverse natural environments on Earth, characterized by elevated
        landforms that rise prominently above the surrounding terrain. These landscapes are shaped primarily by tectonic forces,
        such as the collision and movement of Earth's plates, which create towering peaks, ridges, and valleys.</p>
